#!/usr/bin/env bash
# private_data_scan.sh — aggressive, auto-triggered PII-exposure scanner.
#
# Why this exists (not a rule, not a memory note): a personal phone number
# sat in this PUBLIC repo, in 8 files, across 9 commits, for four months.
# Every existing control was advisory or model-dependent, and every one of
# them failed:
#   - .md rules forbidding PII in public repos were read and ignored under
#     pressure (a PR containing the number was merged anyway).
#   - llm#946 named this exact risk as an open issue; it blocked nothing.
#   - An agent's own PII self-check swept for *billing* keywords, never a
#     phone number, and reported "clean" -- truthfully, for what it checked.
#   - A careful manual check existed but ran on a DIFFERENT PR than the one
#     that mattered.
#   - secret_exposure_scan.sh detects CREDENTIALS, not PII -- no phone
#     pattern exists in it, by design (see "Relationship to
#     secret_exposure_scan.sh" below).
#
# This script is deterministic code, invoked by hooks that do not depend on
# anyone remembering to run it: pre-commit, pre-push, CI (PR gate), and a
# scheduled full-history audit. See .claude/rules/private-data-scanning.md
# for the enforcement architecture (installers, CI workflow, launchd plist)
# -- that rule is DOCUMENTATION; this script and its callers are the
# enforcement.
#
# ─── Relationship to secret_exposure_scan.sh (deliberately BESIDE it, not
# inside it) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# secret_exposure_scan.sh detects CREDENTIALS via shape+entropy: a real API
# key/token is high-entropy by construction (CRED_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD=3.0
# bits/char), and its variable NAME follows KEY/TOKEN/SECRET conventions.
# PII is the opposite shape: a phone number, postcode, or IBAN is highly
# STRUCTURED and LOW entropy (digits in fixed groupings) -- entropy would
# never fire on it, and there is no "PII_KEY_NAME=value" convention to
# anchor a name-based heuristic. The two detector families are disjoint by
# construction; forcing them into one file/one heuristic would degrade both
# (a phone-number-tuned entropy floor would either miss real credentials or
# flag every date/ID as PII). There is also no safe automatic --fix for a
# phone number baked into history the way `chmod 600` is a safe automatic
# fix for a world-readable dotfile -- remediation here is always human
# judgement (git filter-repo / orphan-squash), so the --fix machinery does
# not transfer either. Nothing is duplicated: this file defines zero
# credential-shaped patterns and imports none from
# .claude/hooks/lib/cred_patterns.py; the two scanners run "beside" each
# other -- same directory, same housekeeping_runs heartbeat convention (see
# hk_run_start/hk_run_end below, and the private_data_scan_findings table
# added alongside secret_scan_findings in housekeeping_schema_init.sql),
# same --json/--quiet/--selftest flag conventions -- but are logically
# independent scanners over disjoint pattern sets.
#
# ─── Relationship to repo_visibility_guard.sh (JohnGavin/llm#976) ─────────
# repo_visibility_guard.sh is a ONE-TIME GATE at the moment a repo becomes
# public: it blocks `gh repo create --public` / `gh repo edit --visibility
# public` pending a manual `git log --all -p` history audit. This script
# solves the DIFFERENT, ongoing problem: the repo is ALREADY public, and new
# PII must never enter it via a future commit/push/PR. The two are
# complementary, not competing -- #976 is the one-time visibility gate,
# this is the continuous commit/push/PR/scheduled-audit gate. Neither
# duplicates the other's pattern set on purpose: repo_visibility_guard.sh's
# PRIVACY_ERE (home paths, ~/Downloads, Time Machine, tmutil, "irreplaceable",
# email) targets MACHINE-RECONNAISSANCE disclosure; this script's patterns
# (E.164 phone, UK postcode, IBAN, plus an exact-value denylist) target
# PERSONAL-IDENTIFIER disclosure -- the shape that actually leaked. Where
# both scripts touch git history text, both now pass --no-ext-diff (see
# "THE NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT" below) -- repo_visibility_guard.sh was
# patched in the same change that added this file.
#
# ─── THE NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT: self-check before trusting "clean" ───
# This repo configures difftastic as git's external diff driver
# (diff.external = "difft --display inline", both globally and per-repo).
# `git diff | grep '^+'` is therefore VACUOUS -- difftastic's structural,
# side-by-side output carries no `+`/`-` line prefixes, so the grep matches
# nothing REGARDLESS OF CONTENT and reports clean (JohnGavin/llm#997). A PII
# check is exactly the kind of check written ad-hoc, at the moment
# reassurance is wanted, using `git diff | grep`.
#
# This script is structurally immune to that specific failure: it NEVER
# calls `git diff`/`git log -p`/`git show <commit>` for CONTENT. Every
# content read goes through `git cat-file -p "<tree-ish>:<path>"` (a direct
# blob read -- no diff machinery, no external diff driver, ever invoked).
# The only diff-family calls that remain are NAME enumeration
# (`git diff --cached --name-only`, `git diff-tree --name-only -r`), which
# issue #997 itself confirmed is safe (`--name-only` does not invoke
# textconv/the external diff driver) -- and even those pass --no-ext-diff
# defensively, belt-and-braces, per the issue's own recommendation.
#
# Beyond the structural fix, EVERY invocation of this script (every mode,
# unconditionally, not skippable by any flag) runs assert_can_detect() FIRST
# -- an in-process runtime assertion that feeds a known-bad synthetic
# fixture through the real detector functions and requires a hit. If the
# detector cannot detect its own known-bad fixture, the script aborts with a
# non-zero exit BEFORE scanning anything real. "Clean" is never reported by
# a detector that has not just proven, in this run, it is capable of
# reporting "dirty". See assert_can_detect() below.
#
# ─── Deny-list source: a DEDICATED file, not a direct read of secrets.env ──
# The deny-list lives at ~/.config/private_values.env (KEY=value, mode 600),
# NOT ~/.config/secrets.env, for three reasons:
#   1. Blast radius: secrets.env holds live credentials (API keys, tokens)
#      consumed by many other scripts for operational use (dialling out,
#      launching daemons). Giving this scanner direct read access to
#      secrets.env means every future bug/log-leak in the scanner exposes
#      ALL secrets, not just the handful of PII literals it actually needs.
#   2. Schema coupling: secrets.env's format/contents are owned by a
#      different subsystem (with-secrets, render_signal_launchd_plists.sh)
#      with a different lifecycle (rotation). Coupling this scanner's
#      correctness to that schema means an unrelated secrets.env change can
#      silently break PII detection.
#   3. Wrong shape for the job: most of secrets.env is high-entropy
#      credentials -- exactly what looks_like_credential_value() in
#      secret_exposure_scan.sh is tuned to flag, and exactly what this
#      script must NOT redundantly re-detect (see "beside it, not inside
#      it" above). A deny-list scoped ONLY to "literal values that must
#      never appear" (phone numbers, addresses, personal emails) keeps the
#      two scanners' inputs as disjoint as their pattern sets.
# private_values_sync.sh (delivered alongside this script) extracts named
# keys (e.g. SIGNAL_ACCOUNT, the value llm#946 flagged as embedding a phone
# number) FROM secrets.env INTO private_values.env, so secrets.env stays the
# single source of truth for that value while this scanner gets a narrow,
# independently-permissioned, purpose-built file. This script only ever
# READS private_values.env; it never writes to it.
#
# ─── Fail-closed (deliberate divergence from this repo's usual fail-open
# hook convention) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# secret_leak_guard.sh, repo_visibility_guard.sh, and every other PreToolUse
# guard in this repo fail OPEN on internal error ("a broken guard must never
# wedge a session"). This script fails CLOSED: a missing/unreadable
# deny-list (when required), an internal scanner error, or a failed
# self-check all exit non-zero -- BLOCK, not allow. The two conventions are
# not in tension: PreToolUse guards protect an interactive session where
# wedging the agent has its own cost; this script protects a PUBLISH
# boundary (commit -> push -> merge -> live on a public repo) where the cost
# of a silent false "clean" is a permanent, indexable disclosure. A blocked
# commit is recoverable (fix the error, retry, or use the documented
# bypass); a merged PII leak is not. Local hooks (pre-commit/pre-push) and
# the scheduled full-history audit run with --require-denylist (the
# default) and fail closed if ~/.config/private_values.env is missing,
# unreadable, or empty. CI runs with --no-denylist BY DESIGN (a public
# repo's Actions runner must never be handed personal PII literals, even as
# a masked secret, without an explicit opt-in the user configures
# themselves -- see private-data-scanning.md's CI section) and is NOT a
# fail-closed violation: it is a documented, narrower guarantee (generic
# pattern coverage only), never silently presented as the full guarantee.
#

# --------------------------------------------------
# The original single pattern covered only NPA-555-01XX, i.e. 555 as the
# EXCHANGE. It missed 555 as the AREA CODE (+1555XXXXXXX) -- the older and more
# common fictional convention, and the one this repo's own Signal test fixtures
# actually use. Consequence: private_data_scan.sh blocked commits with 12
# "critical e164-phone" findings across 4 already-committed test files, all of
# them the same fictional number. The scanner's guidance in that state is
# "sanctioned override: git commit --no-verify", so a false positive on a
# SAFETY-CRITICAL gate trains the operator to bypass it. That is a worse
# outcome than the narrow pattern was protecting against -- a gate people
# routinely skip is not a gate.
#
# TRADE-OFF, stated rather than assumed: every range added here is a range the
# scanner will never flag again. That is acceptable ONLY because each is
# reserved by its national regulator and can never be issued to a subscriber,
# so no real person's number can fall inside one. Do NOT add a range merely
# because a fixture happens to use it -- add it only if the regulator reserves
# it. Anything else belongs in the marker-based looks_like_fixture_context()
# path, which requires an explicit EXAMPLE/FAKE/DUMMY/TEST/FIXTURE word.

# Git short-SHA collision guard -- uk-postcode ONLY (see rationale below).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RE_UK_POSTCODE is matched case-insensitively (PII_RULE_CI[uk-postcode]=1),
# so it also matches a bare git abbreviated SHA whenever the SHA happens to
# be composed entirely of hex letters, e.g. ca7f8fd (2 letters + digit +
# alnum + digit + 2 letters -- the exact postcode shape). Naively rejecting
# every all-hex candidate is WRONG: EC1A 1BB is a real London postcode and is
# ALSO all-hex (E,C,1,A,1,B,B are all valid hex characters) -- rejecting
# all-hex would create a false NEGATIVE on real postcodes, which is the wrong
# direction for a privacy gate (a missed leak costs more than a blocked
# commit -- see "prefer the false positive" in this script's task history).
#
# The three signals that together are unique to a git short SHA -- and that
# a conventionally-written postcode never carries all at once -- are:
#   1. every character is a valid hex digit (0-9a-f)
#   2. no whitespace (a real postcode's outward/inward split, even when
#      compacted, is written by a human either WITH the space or in
#      UPPERCASE -- never both stripped AND lowercased in practice)
#   3. every letter is lowercase (git SHAs are always lowercase hex; a real
#      postcode written in prose is conventionally uppercase, e.g. SW1A 1AA,
#      EC1A 1BB -- even a compact, spaceless real postcode like "EC1A1BB"
#      keeps the uppercase convention)
# A single regex captures all three at once: a string matching ^[0-9a-f]+$
# has no uppercase letters (fails #3 otherwise), no non-hex letters (fails
# #1 otherwise), and no whitespace (whitespace is not in the class, so any
# match with the anchors fails #2 otherwise). Any ONE signal missing means
# the candidate stays flagged:
#   EC1A 1BB  -> has a space + uppercase letters -> STILL FLAGGED
#   SW1A 1AA  -> S,W are not hex characters       -> STILL FLAGGED
#   EC1A1BB   -> uppercase letters                -> STILL FLAGGED
#   ca7f8fd   -> all-hex, no space, all-lowercase -> exempted (SHA-shaped)
#
# Known accepted gap: a real postcode written BOTH spaceless AND lowercase
# (e.g. "ec1a1bb") is indistinguishable from a short SHA by this guard and
# would be exempted. This is deliberately accepted as out of scope: PII
# leaks in this repo's history/prose are addresses copy-pasted or typed by a
# human, and postcodes are conventionally cased/spaced in that context (see
# the module header's origin incident) -- the false-negative surface this
# leaves is narrower than the false-positive surface (every 7-char lowercase
# hex git SHA in CHANGELOG/commit-footer text) it closes.
#
# Scoped to uk-postcode only: e164-phone requires a leading '+' (never
# hex-only) and iban's pattern is case-SENSITIVE on an uppercase country
# code (PII_RULE_CI[iban]=0, RE_IBAN starts '[A-Z]{2}'), so a lowercase git
# SHA can never match either -- this collision is unique to uk-postcode's
# combination of an all-alnum shape with case-insensitive matching.

# HTML numeric character reference collision guard -- uk-postcode ONLY.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RE_UK_POSTCODE also matches inside an HTML hex character reference such as
# &#x1F4CB; (an emoji), because the reference's own syntax -- a leading 'x'
# (hex-radix marker) immediately followed by hex digits -- happens to fit
# the same 1-2-letters + digit + alnum + digit + 2-letters shape as a
# compact UK postcode: x1F4CB -> x(letter) 1(digit) F(alnum) 4(digit)
# CB(2 letters). Found live in
# .claude/scripts/send_roborev_weekly_rollup_email.R: "&#x1F4CB; Weekly
# Rollup" (2026-08-23).
#
# Unlike the git-SHA collision above, this is not a shape ambiguity needing
# a multi-signal heuristic: an HTML numeric character reference's own
# delimiters (&# immediately before the payload, ; immediately after) are
# unambiguous, always present in valid markup, and never appear wrapped
# around a postcode written in prose. So the guard is a literal-context
# check: is the candidate match wrapped in "&#<match>;" on the line it came
# from? If yes, it is the entity's hex payload, not a postcode.
#
# Scoped to uk-postcode only, for the same reason as the SHA guard: e164
# requires a leading '+' and iban requires an uppercase country-code prefix
# -- neither can match a lowercase hex entity payload like "x1f4cb".

# Self-reference exemption -- GENERIC-PATTERN DETECTION ONLY, never deny-list.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This scanner's own source (and its sibling private_values_sync.sh, whose
# selftest builds synthetic phone-number fixtures) legitimately contains
# PII-SHAPED text that is not a leak: assert_can_detect()'s liveness probe
# (+19998887766) deliberately carries NO EXAMPLE/FIXTURE marker -- adding
# one would exempt it from the very detection it exists to prove (see
# assert_can_detect()'s own comment on this) -- and this file's own
# RE_UK_POSTCODE doc comment cites example postcode shapes the way any
# regex documentation would. Discovered when this scanner's own PR (#1004)
# tripped its own generic detectors scanning its own source (2026-08-22).
#
# The exemption is deliberately narrow:
#   - EXACT relative paths only, listed below -- never a glob or path
#     prefix. A new file does NOT silently inherit this; adding a path
#     here is a one-line, grep-visible, reviewable change, and the list is
#     scanner-source-only (never a data/config file).
#   - GENERIC-PATTERN detection only (scan_generic, called from
#     scan_blob below). Deny-list detection (scan_denylist) is
#     UNCONDITIONALLY applied to every file, including these two -- a
#     real leaked value sitting in this scanner's own source is still
#     caught. See run_selftest's "deny-list still fires inside an
#     exempted file" case, which exists specifically to prove this
#     boundary holds; without that test this exemption would be a hole,
#     not a fix.
#   - assert_can_detect()'s own probe call uses the "SELFCHECK" location
#     label, which matches nothing in this list -- the liveness check
#     itself is never exempted, so this change does not weaken it.

# .claude/hooks/phi-scan-hook.sh (a DIFFERENT, pre-existing PII hook that
